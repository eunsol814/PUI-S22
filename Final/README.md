## Description
Pathfinding Visualizer helps people better understand different pathfinding algorithms and their search patterns through visualization. The target users
would be people who are interested in learning and trying out pathfinding algorithms under different settings.

## Using the website
- The users would first choose a pathfinding algorithm they would like to visualize from the 'Search Algorithm' dropdown menu. Depending on the algorithm they pick, the users would also have to choose a heuristic from the 'Heuristic' tab as well.
- The users could also generate a maze using maze generation algorithms provided under 'Maze Generation Algorithm' dropdown menu to try out pathfinding algorithms under different board settings. The users could also create a wall by clicking on the board cells and remove a wall by clicking onto it.
- By clicking on the 'Help' on the right of navbar, the users could open a popup modal that provides a brief overall guide to the website.
